Creating a new NPM package using **Create Package Monorepo** is simple. Run the following command:

```bash
npx create-package-monorepo
```
```bash
   ___ ____   ____  ___  ______  ____                     
  //   || \\ ||    // \\ | || | ||

 ____   ___    ___ __ __  ___    ___   ____               
 || \\ // \\  //   || // // \\  // \\ ||                  
 ||_// ||=|| ((    ||<<  ||=|| (( ___ ||==                
 ||    || ||  \\__ || \\ || ||  \\_|| ||___ 
 ___  ___   ___   __  __   ___   ____   ____ ____    ___ 
 ||\\//||  // \\  ||\ ||  // \\  || \\ ||    || \\  // \\ 
 || \/ || ((   )) ||\\|| ((   )) ||_// ||==  ||_// ((   ))
 ||    ||  \\_//  || \||  \\_//  || \\ ||___ ||     \\_// 
                                                          
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to configure your package:

- **Where do you want to create the NPM package?**: Specify the directory where you want to create your package. The default is the current directory.

- **How do you want to name the NPM package?**: Enter a unique name for your NPM package. Ensure it's not already in use on the NPM registry.

- **What is your NPM username?**: Provide your NPM username.

- **What is your GitHub username?**: Enter your GitHub username.

After answering these questions, the tool will generate your package with the specified configuration.

Your newly created package will be available in the specified directory. You can start adding code and customizing it to suit your project's needs.

## Demoable GitHub Pages

The generated monorepo includes a demoable GitHub Pages website that allows you to showcase your package. Customize the demo as needed to demonstrate your package's capabilities.
